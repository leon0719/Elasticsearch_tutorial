Restaurant is big, with high roof, give a sense of space, well lit. Food is great, not mind blowing. We took the unlimited menu, and loved the bacon pizza most. Rest of the pizza was good enough. Among the deserts, the walnut tart was superb, but i didn't like the peanut-butter mousse at all.\n\nBut, in spite of all that, the reason for the 5-star rating is the service we got. We were served by Mr.Nanda, who made us feel absolutely special. He didn't have to. We were a small party of just two people, we weren't ordering off the main menu, and the restaurant discourages tips. In spite of all that, he was extremely attentive (without being intrusive), engaging and helpful. I have been to quite some places, from roadside ones to five-star hotels, rarely have the service been so heart warmingly good. I hope he goes onto much much greater things in life, because he is absolutely brilliant at his work.""), ('Rated 4.0', 'RATED\n  Ambiance - 4/5\nService - 4/5\nFood - 4/5\n\nGreat pizza, served hot and made to order. They take note of what crusts you want for your pizza and I had the thin crust, so I could eat more, and the crust was made amazing also so was the pizza.\nThe service is really good and the place is clean also.

Though the size of the pizzas are kinda small the ones with cream taste good. They ran out of desserts by 9pm which was pretty disappointing. The service was okay but can be improved."")]",[],Cafes,Banashankari
